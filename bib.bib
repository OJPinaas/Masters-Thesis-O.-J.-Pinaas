Electroencephalography (EEG) is the non-invasive measurement of the brain’s electric fields. Electrodes placed on the scalp record voltage potentials resulting from current flow in and around neurons. EEG is nearly a century old: this long history has afforded EEG a rich and diverse spectrum of applications. On the one hand, foundations of EEG in clinical diagnostics have dovetailed more recently into brain-triggered neurorehabilitation treatments. On the other hand, EEG has not only been a workhorse for providing brain correlates of constructs in the field of experimental psychology, but has also been used as a true neuroimaging method with more recent extensions in translational as well as computational neuroscience. The versatility and accessibility of the technique, in combination with advances in signal processing, allow for this ‘old dog’ to still deliver new tricks and innovations.}

abstract = {fMRI and EEG are complimentary methods for the analysis of brain activity since each method has its strength where the other one has limits: The spatial resolution is thus in the range of millimeters with fMRI and the time resolution is in the range of milliseconds with EEG. For a comprehensive understanding of brain activity in target detection, nine healthy subjects (age 24.2 ± 2.9) were investigated with simultaneous EEG (27 electrodes) and fMRI using an auditory oddball paradigm. As a first step, event-related potentials, measured inside the scanner, have been compared with the potentials recorded in a directly preceding session in front of the scanner. Attenuated amplitudes were found inside the scanner for the earlier N1/P2 component but not for the late P300 component. Second, an independent analysis of the localizations of the fMRI activations and the current source density as revealed by low resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) has been done. Concordant activations were found in most regions, including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the supplementary motor area (SMA)/anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the insula, and the middle frontal gyrus, with a mean Euclidean distance of 16.0 ± 6.6 mm between the BOLD centers of gravity and the LORETA-maxima. Finally, a time-course analysis based on the current source density maxima was done. It revealed different time-course patterns in the left and right hemisphere with earlier activations in frontal and parietal regions in the right hemisphere. The results suggest that the combination of EEG and fMRI permits an improved understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity.}

abstract = {Preceded by a companion paper on Galvani’s life, this article is written on the occasion of the bicentenary of the death of Luigi Galvani. From his studies on the effects of electricity on frogs, the scientist of Bologna derived the hypothesis that animal tissues are endowed with an intrinsic electricity that is involved in fundamental physiological processes such as nerve conduction and muscle contraction. Galvani’s work swept away from life sciences mysterious fluids and elusive entities like “animal spirits” and led to the foundation of a new science, electrophysiology. Two centuries of research work have demonstrated how insightful was Galvani’s conception of animal electricity. Nevertheless, the scholar of Bologna is still largely misrepresented in the history of science, because the importance of his researches seems to be limited to the fact that they opened the paths to the studies of the physicist Alessandro Volta, which culminated in 1800 with the invention of the electric battery. Volta strongly opposed Galvani’s theories on animal electricity. The matter of the scientific controversy between Galvani and Volta is examined here in the light of two centuries of electrophysiological studies leading to the modern understanding of electrical excitability in nerve and muscle. By surveying the work of scientists such as Nobili, Matteucci, du Bois-Reymond, von Helmholtz, Bernstein, Hermann, Lucas, Adrian, Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz, the real matter of the debate raised by Galvani’s discoveries is here reconsidered. In addition, a revolutionary phase of the 18th century science that opened the way for the development of modern neurosciences is reevaluated.}

    ABSTRACT={<p>The mouse brain is the most extensively studied brain of all species. We performed an exhaustive review of the literature to establish our current state of knowledge on cell numbers in mouse brain regions, arguably the most fundamental property to measure when attempting to understand a brain. The synthesized information, collected in one place, can be used by both theorists and experimentalists. Although for commonly-studied regions cell densities could be obtained for principal cell types, overall we know very little about how many cells are present in most brain regions and even less about cell-type specific densities. There is also substantial variation in cell density values obtained from different sources. This suggests that we need a new approach to obtain cell density datasets for the mouse brain.</p>}

	abstract = {Prior studies have shown that neuronal spikes can be recorded with microelectrode arrays placed on the cortical surface. However, the etiology of these spikes remains unclear. Because the top cortical layer (layer 1) contains very few neuronal cell bodies, it has been proposed that these spikes originate from neurons with cell bodies in layer 2. To address this question, we combined two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiological recordings from the cortical surface in awake mice using chronically implanted PEDOT:PSS electrode arrays on transparent parylene C substrate.Our electrode arrays (termed Windansee) were integrated with cortical windows offering see-through optical access while also providing measurements of local field potentials (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) from the cortical surface. To enable longitudinal data acquisition, we have developed a mechanical solution for installation, connectorization, and protection of Windansee devices aiming for an unhindered access for high numerical aperture microscope objectives and a lifetime of several months while worn by a mouse.Contrary to the common notion, our measurements revealed that only a small fraction of layer 2 neurons from the sampled pool (~13\%) faithfully followed MUA recorded from the surface above the imaging field-of-view. Surprised by this result, we turned to computational modeling for an alternative explanation of the MUA signal. Using realistic modeling of neurons with back-propagating dendritic properties, we computed the extracellular action potential at the cortical surface due to firing of local cortical neurons and compared the result to that due to axonal inputs to layer 1. Assuming the literature values for the cell/axon density and firing rates, our modeling results show that surface MUA due to axonal inputs is over an order of magnitude larger than that due to firing of layer 2 pyramidal neurons.Thus, a combination of surface MUA recordings with two-photon calcium imaging can provide complementary information about the input to a cortical column and the local circuit response. Cortical layer I plays an important role in integration of a broad range of cortico-cortical, thalamocortical and neuromodulatory inputs. Therefore, detecting their activity as MUA while combining electrode recording with two-photon imaging using optically transparent surface electrode arrays would facilitate studies of the input/output relationship in cortical circuits, inform computational circuit models, and improve the accuracy of the next generation brain-machine interfaces.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
